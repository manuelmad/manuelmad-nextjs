                        <p>A mobile app, made using Expo and React Native, to create shopping lists.</p>
                        <p>Choose a product from the drop-down list, enter the quantity you want to purchase, and it will appear in your shopping list. You'll see an estimated cost for all products added to the list.</p>
                        <p>Tap any product in the list once to cross it out and subtract its cost from the estimated total, and tap it again to remove the cross-out and add its cost back.
                        Tap and hold any product in the list to delete it individually. You can delete all products using the "Clear List" button.</p>
                        <p>It also counts with an editable database so the user can customize the app.</p>

                        <p>This is a private web app that is related to a client's public website. They are both developed with Next JS.</p>
                        <p>The website takes the information of images, titles and texts of each article from a Firebase database.</p>
                        <p>The web editor is a clone of the website, but with the obvious difference that it allows the user to upload new content to the database so the website is automatically updated.</p>
                        <p>To access the web editor, the client first logs in with the correct email and password, and then all the options to make changes to the website are available: upload new images and write new titles and texts.</p>
                        <p>In this way; a client can edit a website, that was initially developed by me writing code, whenever they want and from any device with an internet connection; by using a simple interface and without writing code.</p>

                        <p>There are also some areas to add additional costs from products that clients can ask that don't exist in the catalog.</p>
                        <p>At the end, there is a template of a budget with the company logo so they can take a capture of it and send it to the client.</p>

                        <p>It then selects the highest value among them all (critical hook load) and uses it, along with other input data, to calculate the minimum required capacity for the drilling rig's derrick.</p>
                        <p>Then, it uses the weight in the air of the heaviest string to calculate the minimum required power in drilling rig's drawworks.</p>

                        <p>Planeta Geek is an excellent Venezuelan tv show based on videogames, tv series, movies, japanese animation and esports.</p>
                        <p>I created this landing page as a recognition for their effort, and also give them the chance to have more resources to reach new people.</p>
                        <p>The landging page includes a “web apps” section, where I included the links to some applications I've made to help them with the activities they perform for the public, including a Planeta Geek Videogame I developed with JS.</p>
